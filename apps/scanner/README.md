# Scanner

This is a demo app that does a Battlestar Galactica-style scans of a single red pixel across a NeoPixel strip using the `Nerves.IO.Neopixel` library.

Currently, it's set up to be built using the [`nerves-system-br`](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-system-br) project directly, but I'm planning to figure out how to do it using the new [Bakeware](http://www.bakeware.io) tool instead.

See more details on my blog post: [Driving NeoPixels with Elixir and Nerves](http://www.gregmefford.com/blog/2016/01/22/driving-neopixels-with-elixir-and-nerves/).
